### Meetings

The team will meet on Mondays at 2 pm as part of our scheduled lab time. This meeting will outline every members' role for the upcoming week and an initial discussion of what needs to be done for the milestone. We will also meet Friday mornings at 10 am and Saturdays at 10 am to finalize and combine our individual components of the project. All times are Pacific Standard Time as all members are based out of Vancouver.

### Conflict

If one or more members of the team are experiencing a conflict, they will attempt to talk it out together to see if they can come to a reasonable and peaceful resolution. If the issue cannot be resolved with the help of all the team members, then the issue will be taken to the course instructor or to the MDS directors for a resolution.


### Communication

The preferred methods of communication will be Slack for day to day items and quick communication. Github will be used for more important matters that require documentation and direct project collaboration. Github will also serve as a record of the milestone goals and who is responsible for which item. Team meetings will take place over Zoom calls.

### Working As A Team On GitHub

There will be a milestone branch created at the start of each week. Every subsequent branch will then be created from that milestone branch by individual team members. All commits on GitHub will be reviewed by at least one member of the team before being merged to the milestone branch. We are opting not to fork the main repo to hopefully make the process more smooth and encounter fewer merge conflicts.

Team members are expected to pull from the main or milestone branch every time before working on their next piece of the project. Team members should also test and review their code and documents before submitting a pull request.

### Milestone Final Submissions

- Milestone 1 will be submitted by Chad
- Milestone 2 will be submitted by Rachel
- Milestone 3 will be submitted by Saule
- Milestone 4 will be submitted by Craig
