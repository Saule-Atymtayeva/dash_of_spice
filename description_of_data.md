## Description of Data

The happiness rating data is presented for 2015-2020 with more than 150 countries for each year. To calculate the Happiness Score, the following main indicators are taken into account:

- GDP per capita
- Social support
- Healthy (Life Expectancy)
- Freedom to make life choices
- Generosity
- Perceptions of corruption.

The scores for these variables are based on both statistical data and the results of public opinion surveys of residents of different countries about how happy they feel, conducted by the Gallup International Research Center, which ask respondents in each country to rate their feeling of happiness on a special scale.
