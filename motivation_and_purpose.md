Motivation and Purpose
================

Our Role: Data scientists working for an immigration consulting company

Target Audience: Families and individuals looking to move to a new
country.

The stigma surrounding mental health has been slowing evaporating over
the years as more and more people openly talk about their mental
struggles and seek help. Families want to raise their kids in a society
that promotes happiness, financial security, and a long life expectancy,
among other things. Our purpose is to help facilitate the decision
making process for people who wish to move to a new country by providing
them with an easy to use app that compares countries across the world.
We propose using the World Happiness Report as our data set to create
this app. Our intent is that an individual will be able to specify what
criteria (happiness, GDP per capita, freedom to make life choices, etc.)
are most important to them in their choice of a new country and then
display the most promising results coupled with interpretable graphs and
key values.
